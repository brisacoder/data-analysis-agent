# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed `parse_dataframe_info_with_columns()` function calls

**Problem**: The function was being called with only one parameter, but it requires two:
- `info_output: str` - The output from `df.info()`
- `actual_columns: list` - The actual column names from `df.columns`

**Solution**: 
- Added a helper function `create_dataframe_json(df)` that properly calls the function with both parameters
- This function mimics exactly what the CLI code does:
  ```python
  def create_dataframe_json(df: pd.DataFrame) -> str:
      """Create DataFrame info JSON using the same method as the CLI."""
      buffer = io.StringIO()
      df.info(buf=buffer)
      return parse_dataframe_info_with_columns(buffer.getvalue(), list(df.columns))
  ```

### 2. Removed API Key Mocking

**Problem**: Tests were using `@mock.patch.dict(os.environ, {'OPENAI_API_KEY': 'test-key-for-unit-tests'})` which is unnecessary and complicates testing.

**Solution**:
- Added `load_dotenv()` at the top of the test file to load environment variables from `.env` file
- Removed all `@mock.patch.dict` decorators
- Tests now use real environment variables from `.env` file
- Added simple check: `if not os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'):` to skip integration tests when no key is available

### 3. Added Proper Test Markers

**Problem**: Integration tests weren't properly marked.

**Solution**:
- Added `@pytest.mark.integration` to all tests that make real LLM calls
- This allows running integration tests separately with `pytest -m integration`

### 4. Removed Unused Imports

**Problem**: `unittest.mock` was imported but no longer used after removing the mocking.

**Solution**:
- Removed `from unittest import mock`
- Kept necessary imports: `io` for `StringIO` buffer creation

## Test Results

After fixes:
- ✅ **Unit tests**: 7 passed (no API calls needed)
- ✅ **Integration test**: 1 passed (real LLM call successful)
- ✅ **Helper function**: Working correctly with proper DataFrame info generation

## Key Improvements

1. **More Realistic Testing**: Tests now use the exact same DataFrame info generation process as the production code
2. **Simpler Environment Setup**: Just needs `.env` file with API key, no mocking required
3. **Better Test Organization**: Clear separation between unit and integration tests
4. **Proper Error Handling**: Tests skip gracefully when API key is not available

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests only (no API calls)
pytest tests/test_planner.py -k "not integration" -v

# Run integration tests only (requires API key in .env)
pytest tests/test_planner.py -m integration -v

# Run all tests
pytest tests/test_planner.py -v

# Using the test runner script
python run_tests.py unit
python run_tests.py integration
```

## Verification

The fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Unit tests pass without API key
- ✅ Integration tests pass with real API key from `.env` file
- ✅ Helper function generates proper DataFrame JSON
- ✅ No more missing parameter errors
- ✅ Tests use real environment variables properly
