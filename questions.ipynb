      "RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "1. Consider log transformation for highly skewed data\n",
      "2. Consider outlier treatment (removal, capping, or transformation)\n",
      "3. Fix datetime parsing errors or standardize date formats\n",
      "4. Handle missing values (imputation or removal)\n",
      "5. High missing rate - consider dropping column\n",
      "6. Review future dates for validity\n",
      "7. Standardize case formatting (e.g., title case or lowercase)\n",
